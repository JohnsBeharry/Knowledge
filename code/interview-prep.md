**Arrays** cannot be modified - to add a new element, the origional gets  copied and the new elements amended (or removed).

Sum the elements of the array - and subtract from 

*Does not work if array has more than one missing numbers*

```
n(n+1)/2

array = [1,2,3,5] # missing number 4
count = 5
count * (count + 1) / 2 - sum(array)
```
