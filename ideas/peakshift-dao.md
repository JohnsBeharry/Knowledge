Employees are rejecting the structures that traditional companies have been established on, by requested to work from home to reduce cost of comunite and take back their time.

Task API

#### Standards & Processes

In any well functoning system, it is important to have defined, and accessible  process that get enforced not by management but by .

Anyone can document a process and earn money.

Enforcing High Quality ‚Äî Having a mechanism to enforce the agency's standards are just as important as having the standards themselves.

Everything should be able to be reviewed and a cost associated with not ‚Äî this will enable the overall quality of work to remain at a high standard.

Reviewers can be human or automations.

Scenarios in which reviewers are necessary:

- Pull requests
- Code quality
- Pull request meets the correct format
- Commit messages style is enforced

#### Staking & Reputation

<u>Benefits</u> of Staking:

- Workers are incentives to only work on tasks they feel they are competitent enough to complete.
- With a worker staking an amount of money to work on tasks; it is possible to punish bad behavior like not following the agency's standards in order to maintain / encourage a high quality of work.

<u>Problems</u> with staking in order to do work:

- Don't have enough money to start working.

<u>Solutions</u>:

- Reward smaller unskilled work like reviewing work meets standards.

#### Development Options

- Collection of smart contracts written to enforce the rules of operation.
- An Application layer ontop of the Colony protocol which has the added benifit of a built in reputation system.
