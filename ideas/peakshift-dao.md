# Peak Shift ‚Äî DAO

A platform for work that workers, individuality, choice.

A factory for work which does not make asumptions on collaboration but allows for worker autonomy.

Communities and collaborations will form naturally as humans we tend to grativaite to such groupings.

*A decentralised digital agency ‚Äî solidified in code, goverened by all, enforced by staking‚Ä¶*

#### Introduction

The future of work requires companies give their staff flexibility so they can design their lives the way they want.

Employees are rejecting the structures of traditional companies ‚Äî they have been requesting to work from home in order to reduce costs, be more productive, and allocate time to do other things.

‚Äî up to 4 hours per day which was used for commute (find source for commute time).

These workers then started traveling, sometimes. (find source about incrase of work from home)

These companies then saw the benfiits of hiring workers from (find source)

 because they are too rigid.

We see a rise in freelance, self employed and contractor roles. The current wave of sucesses startups like AirBnB, Uber, Deliveroo, TaskRabbit have shown proof the 

#### Task Based vs Time Based ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Should work be measured by the amount of time it takes to complete or the value of the result?

The latter suggests that work time becomes a comodity.

Here's a breakdown of pros and cons for <u>Task based pricing</u> of work:

| PROS                                     | CONS                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Specialisation of tasks can drive prices down for projects. | Time is always a constraint ‚Äî so it should also be factored into the pricing. |
| Standaridsation of work and pricing makes decision making easier ‚Äî as there is less ambigutiy on the result. | Fix time rewards may be to rigid for projects ‚Äî although it is seen as more |
|                                          |                                          |

#### Concensus Mechanism ‚Äî PoW

Therefore a consensus mechanism needs to be thouigh of in order to verify work is being done as the service provider claims.

// COMMENTS
### Stake to Work
In order to have a system which enables two individuals that have no reason to trust each other to come together in a client-service marketplace, it is fundimental to come up with a way to not only protect the worker/service provider, but also to validate the service provider is acting truthfully and performing the work they claim.

// RESEARCH

As TrueBit is working to solve problems with verifiable computations -- Peak Shift aims to verfiy work by service providers.

#### Tasks

Attributes making up a task:

- Type of Work (this may have to be set by reviewers, as a non-technical product owner may not assign the work correctly)
- Acceptance Criteria `(off chain, capa.space content_id)`
  - Defined as Gherkin scenarios
  - Change of scope is punished
- Tests `(off chain, capa.space content_id)`
  - Coded tests
- Estimated Time `(on chain, uint)`
- Work Logged `()`
- Worker `(on chain, address)`
- Reviewer `(on chain, contract address)`
- Output `(off chain, git repository)`
- Invoice `()`
- Stake `(on chain, token e.g. DAI)`

#### Reviewers / Validators

Enforcing High Quality ‚Äî Having a mechanism to enforce the agency's standards are just as important as having the standards themselves.

Everything should be able to be reviewed and a cost associated with not ‚Äî this will enable the overall quality of work to remain at a high standard.

Reviewers can be human or automations.

Scenarios in which reviewers are necessary:

- Pull requests
- Code quality
- Pull request meets the correct format
- Commit messages style is enforced

#### Staking & Reputation

<u>Benefits</u> of Staking:

- Workers are incentives to only work on tasks they feel they are competitent enough to complete.
- With a worker staking an amount of money to work on tasks; it is possible to punish bad behavior like not following the agency's standards in order to maintain / encourage a high quality of work.

<u>Problems</u> with staking in order to do work:

- Don't have enough money to start working.

<u>Solutions</u>:

- Reward smaller unskilled work like reviewing work meets standards.

#### Standards & Processes

In any well functoning system, it is important to have defined, and accessible  process that get enforced not by management but by .

Anyone can document a process and earn money.

#### Development Options

- Collection of smart contracts written to enforce the rules of operation.
- An Application layer ontop of the Colony protocol which has the added benifit of a built in reputation system.

#### Colony

- Colony is a protocol that allows for decentalised human organisations simmilar to Peak Shift DAO
- Difference is Colony starts with the communtiy.
- We will to stay away from enforced community or governance onto the workers.
  - What about the systems hourly rate?
  - Who manages rates for different kinds of work?
