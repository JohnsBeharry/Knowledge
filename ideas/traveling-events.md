# Events on the Go

## PROBLEM

Traveling to a different country as much as I do makes it difficult to host and manage an event — but it would be a fantasitic way to grow the Peak Shift community in different regions.

## SOLUTION

When visiting a new location, connect with a local community to promote a Peak Shift event through — .

Example of how this could would would be simmilar to the Peak Shift x CaribbeanTechForum meetup in Trinidad 2017.
