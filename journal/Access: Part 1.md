# Access: Part 1

`September 12, 2017 at 11:15 AM`

I'm from the Caribbean and recently myself and a colleage at my company spent 2 months in Kenya and Rwanda this year meeting with startups and techies and it was really inspiring and educational — we met a a startup founder in Rwanda who makes floors for people in rural areas using science! — they created an alternative to concerte using local materials. In Mombasa we met one developer who works on a startup providing legal aid over mobile.

I'm from a place where people also consider third world but regardless this, we have created a technology consulting company that works with clients in all regions of the globe. I'm eager to meet more people who perceiver past the environment, and infrustructure they are dealt with to create things.

Especially those in the technology industry where this infrusctuture is so critical to operate.

First we will talk about financial inclusion - digital products in the developing world.

Gabriel Abed, the founder of the first Bitcoin Exchange in the carribean, Bitt.com said it best. We can make international standards products, but we cannot sell them internationally.

Many people I speak to from more developed nations do not understand that this is still a problem in the world - which is surprising as improvements in the developing world is one of the main naratives in the Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency space. It's also what got me exicted about this technology 5 years ago.

### The Ridiculousness of Payments in Paradise

I'm from an island called Saint Lucia, the island just south of us is St. Vincent - but it would take 3-5 days to transfer money from my bank account in Saint Lucia to an employee in St. Vincent, even though it's just 45km away. You can see the other island - but ye 3 days.

For founders and creatives of technology products in the region, this is a common restriction we have to live with.

### Why is there no e-commerce?

People cannot accept money online - and even accepting international payments even is difficult.
