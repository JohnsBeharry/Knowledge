# Art + Technology

I have a shaky relationship with art — or little understanding of its place now.

On one hand, it represents freedom of expression which I enjoy. Through out time, art has been used to spread messages about current affairs, and ideologies to the masses. To evoke an emotion — or a thought, or a type of thinking.

We are at a tipping point now though — the tools and access to a wide audience is in our pockets. These devices do not only allow us to spread a message (art) but to build solutions that can address our greviances…

Although it has been is important to spread messages and ideologies to the masses, we now have easier access to create and spread solutions.

## Technology defines art

- Artist utilise the technology that is available
- Invension of the camera required stage actors to adapt and perform for the camera instead of a live audience

## Looking back

When I was younger, I would enjoy creating worlds and characters with pencil and paper — we didn't have cable tv at the time so an imagination was my form of entertainment.
