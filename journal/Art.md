# Art

I have a shaky relationship with art --

On one hand, it represents freedom of expression which I beleive in. Historically it has been used to spread messages about current affairs, and ideologies to the masses.

For me, I do not see it as necessity for humanity to focus it's efforts on currently as we are at a tipping point -- we have the tools and freedoms now to not only spread a message (art) but to build  solutions that can address those greviances... 

Although it has been is important to spread messages and ideologies to the masses, we now have easier access to create and spread solutions.
