I'm from a island in the Caribbean called Saint Lucia. It is a paradise, and in my travels many people I meet ask why I moved away — I will tell you the realitiy. You see, working in tech in this region means you have to rely on very poor infruatructe and limited access. For example - PayPal holds your incoming funds for 21 days, merchant accounts from local banks are extreemly expensive and also require a security deposit that isn't practical for a new startup, there is no Stripe to accept credit cards on your website.

A fellow Caribbean tech entrepreneur Gabrial Abed founder of Bitt.com phrased it like this —

> *"we can build international standard technology products but we cannot' get get paid for it"*

We are on an island literally, and metaphorically. Locked out of the digital economy.

Thats why when I discovered Bitcoin in 2012 I knew this was something which is going to be the great equaliser -- modern infrustructure for global payments, without restrictions of class, connections, or borders.
