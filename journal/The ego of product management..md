# The ego of project management.

It seems like owning the strategic direction of a product is the most glorified position to have.

The product manager is the one who takes the glory, and will dictate what the product is, and what it will be. The product manager is the one who can craft the direction of the product.

What does a product manager do?

So why does everyone want to be the product manager?

Who should be appointed this role though?

- Should there be multiple product managers?

*Without a sceintfic method and it becomes a clash of egos.*
