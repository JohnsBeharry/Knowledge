"One designer, in a single day can create months of work for an developer"

Unpopular opinion, but I think the reality is that it's not designers who are in charge of user experience, it's whomever is handling implementation.

I've seen many technical teams shatter several months of work, effectively throwing the designers time in the drain due to poor implementation.

Why does this happen though?

\1. Unless you've got a large enough team - a single designer isn't usually able to create designs with close to 0 ambiguity.

Design a happy path that looks great. If you're lucky get empty states too, but then deal with the error states.

---

This is a limitation of the tool we work with though. Even designing clickable prototypes is limited, cases are fixed, and flows we conceive are mostly linear.

User behaviours and the environment the software runs are not.

Phone batteries die.

Connection is intermittent.

Space runs out.

Screens are broken.
