## How we got here

POS ideas focused on Weak Subjectitivity

- Under what conditions are proof of stake and slashing more secure.
- Peer Coin were possible

Casper / Concensus by Bet

- More and more people willing to bet...

Blockchain Rent

- EIP #35

Quadratic Sharding, was complicated

Fishermans Dilema

- You can 

DAO and Shanghai DOS slowed down scaling research and development for ~6 months.

###### 2017

Minimal Slashing conditions

Casper FFG

- minimal slashing conditions, simplified for a blockchain context.
- blocks appear all the time, each time a new round starts you add data to the round.
- 6 slashing conditions -> 4 slashing conditions -> ... how many slashing conditions in the beacon chain?

Casper CBC

Erasure coding data availability

###### 2018

- Fork Choice Rule / Ghost

- Verifiable Delay Functions
- Rent / Storage Maintenance Fees

Cross Shard Transactions

- Eth Research / Cross shard contract yanking
- Eth Research / Syncronous cross-shard transacftions with consolodated concurrency control concensus.

##### Phases

###### Metropolis

- Bezentium
- Constantinople `feb-2019`

###### Serenity

Eth 1.0 on a contract on the beacon chain, with ...

1. Phase 0: Bacon Chain PoS
2. Phase 1: Shards as data chains
   1. Doesn't do sharding of state, but sharding of data
   2. Can make decentralised twitter but not more complicated smart contract applications 
3. Phase 2: 
4. Phase 3: Itterate improve
   1. Layer 3 execution engines
      1. privancy
      2. cross shard transactions, semi private chains
      3. proof of stake improvements
      4. casper CBC when there is a version that makes sense
      5. Use starks for signature aggression and maybe checking state of execution.



###### Research

Becasue of the following there will be more finality?

1. Research options for Fork Choice Rules
2. Signature Aggregation



1. How can SNARKS and STARKs be used for Scaling
