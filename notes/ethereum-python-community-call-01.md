# Preparation for Ethereum Python Community Roundup

The meeting is all about getting feedback about what us Pythonistas want in a dapp framework, and also coordination of what tools we ourselves would build with the existing set of tools [@pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam)'s team has already built.

- [Agenda](https://notes.ethereum.org/MKhgrLytTOuno-GrT7EYoA?view)

### Trinity

An Ethereum client built in Python 

- https://medium.com/@pipermerriam/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-trinity-ethereum-client-b093c756d1de
- https://trinity.ethereum.org

### Populus

Ethereum development framework for Python 

- https://github.com/ethereum/populus
- [@pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam)

##### TALKING POINTS

- Perhaps the Dapp demo should incorporate the populus framework
- The Flask-Ethereum project I started seems like it would be recreating some of the functionalities of populus, for example deploying contracts from the CLI, interacting with the contract (populus has pytest-etherum).

### Twig / Vyper IDE

- ???

#### ETHEREUM DEVELOPER CALL

- [ ] Reseach pytest plugins, what are they used for?
- [x] What is Ethereum Trinity?
- [ ] https://github.com/voith/eth-tester-rpc
- [ ] What do pythonistias want from a Dapp framework?
  - [ ] NOTE: Python is server side, the premise of a Dapp is that it needs to be able to live on non centralised servers â€” how will the frontend development side be handled?
