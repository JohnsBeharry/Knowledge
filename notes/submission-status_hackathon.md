### Background (max 1000 characters)

I'm from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia where I've spent most of my life - until I started to travel 4 years ago then I never stopped. Many people often ask me why I would want to be away from such a paradise — which it very much is — but the reality is it is under-developed and, some infrustructures people take for granted like payments. Something which I saw Bitcoin being able to provide in terms of a modern infrustructure for global payments.

A fellow Caribbean tech person phrased it like this — "we can build international standard technology products but we cannot' get get paid"

### Why do you want to participate? (max 2000 characters)
