# Beacon Chain — Ethereum 2.0

*The Beacon Chain is a proposal for a combined Sharding and Proof-of-Stake architecture.*

## OVERVIEW

Prior to [the eth2.0 proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/casper_sharding_v2.1.md), plans for scaling Ethereum were seperated into two projects. [Casper FFG](1) and [Sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding/blob/develop/docs/doc.md).

### Casper FFG

1500 Eth would be staked in a contract by someone wishing to be a block validator

### Sharding
