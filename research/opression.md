### What is Oppression?

> In its traditional usage, oppression means the exercise of tyranny by a ruling group. Yet, oppression creates injustice in other circumstances as well. People are not always oppressed by cruel tyrants with bad intentions. In many cases, a well-intentioned liberal society can place system-wide constraints on groups and limit their freedom. 
>
> Oppression can be the result of a few people’s choices or policies that cause embedded unquestioned norms, habits, and symbols. These societal rules can become an restrictive structure of forces and barriers that immobilize and reduce a group or category of people. 

>  Oppression is when people reduce the potential for other people to be fully human

### Types of Opression

###### Exploitation

Exploitation uses capitalism to oppress.

The economic theory of capitalism states that people are free to exchange goods freely. Yet, whenever this has happens throughout history, it has created different classes of people: wealthy and poor.

> *Karl Marx, the father of socialism, said that capitalism creates “haves” (those that have wealth) and “have-nots”*

###### Powerlessness

###### Marginalization

Marginalization is in some ways worse than exploitation because society has decided that it cannot or will not use these people even for labor.

> powerlessness that creates what Freire calls a Culture of Silence... oppressed people become so powerless that they do not even talk about their oppression

###### Cultural Imperialism

- Art tied to freedom of speech?
- Art being a waste of time?
