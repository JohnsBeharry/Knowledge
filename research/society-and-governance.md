# Society, Markets and Governance

###### Industrial democracy

- workplaces are run directly by the people who work in them in place of [private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector) or [state ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership) of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production)

###### Voluntary society

- A **voluntary society**, **voluntary community** or **voluntary city** is one in which all property (including streets, parks, etc.) and all services (including courts, police, etc.) are provided through voluntary means, such as private or cooperative ownership. 

###### Anarcho-capitalism

- Society tends to [contractually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) self-regulate and civilize through the spontaneous and organic discipline of the free market

###### Rent-seeking

- In public choice theory and in economics, rent-seeking involves seeking to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth
