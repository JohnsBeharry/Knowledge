NOTES

- The collapse, according to the Kunapa people, made it impossible for them to continue perceiving the site as part of a traditional songline

  - what other tangiable costs lost?

- people who are attached to particular external objects ought to have a special say on how those objects are used

- the recognition of group-differentiated rights required to protect cultures as the context of choice in which individual autonomy often takes shape

  - is it right to offer rights to one group and not the other?
  - how do you join the group?
    - social acceptance
    - some other official/formal means?
    - leads to more labeling?

- fiercely opposed by a number of fur traders but explicitly exempts products obtained by traditional indigenous communities such as the Canadian Inuit

  - is structual injustices affecting these people -- that leads to lesser access to resources, and opportunities?

- not be justifiable to deprive such groups from access to resources they were attached to and that were crucial to sustain traditional practices

- Pro-hunting activists insisted during their campaign on the importance of fox-hunting to sustain traditional English values and a rural way of life, increasingly threatened by city elites.

  - must everyone converge to a single, globalist ideology?

- the ban was supported by many Britons who saw fox-hunting as a social practice essential only to sustain an aristocratic pastime which reproduced divisive class distinctions

  - can it also be argued that there is cultural heritage of the aristocrats?

- think about the scene in Doctor Zhivago where Yuri returns to Moscow on the eve of the Bolshevik revolution and is told by his wife Tonya that they now have to get used to live in a small space because many of the rooms in their big family house had to be offered to the new agricultural academy.[3](http://www.jpe.ox.ac.uk/papers/structural-injustice-and-the-place-of-attachment/#footnote-26245-3) But all this has little to do with the fact that attachment to certain objects gives those who are related to such objects special claims on their use.

  - 

- So why are we more sympathetic to the claims of members of some groups but not others?

  - because of structural injusticed that they are subjected to?
  - ...

- **members of the first group have traditionally been implicated in systems of rules that they have coercively imposed on others**

  - would it be argued that looking within the group; members within the aristocrats, or aborigonal groups themselves could also have had rules imposed on them by the group at large?
  - do all members of the aristocrats favor the not having a ban?
  - look at the individuals instead?
  - who makes up the *countryside alliance* and how are it's membership managed?
    - aristocrats who have hold on to the idea that fox hunting is part of their culture
    - perhaps other non aristocrat individuals also favor to keep fox hunting?

- **members of the second group have been victims of injustice and ongoing oppression whose effects persist in the present**

  - some members? all members?

- But suppose Nora and Victor have now both died, and it is their children who are next door neighbours. What should they do with their shared allotment?

  If continuing to grant Nora’s family a special claim over the use of the allotment is important to ensure that they feel respected by their neighbours, that they remain integrated in the area, that they continue to be free from stigmatization and disrespect, and that they are not bullied by the family of Victor ever again

- **The tainted history of interaction with their bullying colonial masters continues to affect the way these groups relate to each other, the position in society of their members**

  - this seems to consider the groups to be homogenous, therefore doesn't take into account mixed people?
    - is a mixed colonial (white) + aborigonal/black/indian get half of what a non-mixed member get?
  - what objective, quantitative measure can be used to determine share and belonging to the group? should genomics be employed?
  - to be rightfully fair, and the quantitative measure is genome sequencing -- we would need to also have this histoical genome data of the origional groups that were oppressed.
  - there is a movement towards self categorisation --

#### Gun Control in Tradition and Culture

- *"strict controls had helped China avoid a US-style "gun culture", and the rampage had proved that it's necessary to maintain this policy."*
- "*However in China, gun crime is rare, as private citizens are forbidden from owning and selling guns.* "
